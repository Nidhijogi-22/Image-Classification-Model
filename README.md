**🖼️ Image Classification with CNN**
A deep learning project that classifies images into predefined categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

📁 Dataset
Used an image dataset with multiple classes (e.g., CIFAR-10).
Each image is labeled with its corresponding category.

🔧 Preprocessing
Resized and normalized image data
Encoded labels for classification
Split into training and validation sets

🧠 Model
Built a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Included layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout.
Trained over multiple epochs with accuracy and loss tracking.

📊 Evaluation
Training and validation accuracy/loss curves
Classification report and confusion matrix

🚀 Future Enhancements
Use pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) with transfer learning
Deploy model with a Flask/Streamlit web app
